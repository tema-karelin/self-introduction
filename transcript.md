Hello!

My name is Artem and I’m junior frontend developer.

I'm from Minsk (Belarus), but I've been living in Georgia for 3 months already. I want to tell you my story which started 3 years ago.

I, being a last year student of the Power Plant Construction faculty of Belarussian National Technical University, realized that shipbuilding (my specialty) in Belarus is not developed and I will not earn much on it.

It was necessary to search for courses in order to have time to find a job before the distribution. I've heard a lot of good comments about RS School, so I decide to choose them. When I passed the first stage, I’ve got a job in the IBA company, but, surprise, in the SAP department.

2019th was clearly not an easy year, life tested me to the fullest: graduate work, distribution, employment, marriage. For 3 years of work in IBA, I did not have to use SAP. I worked with html, css, bootstrap, JavaScript, vue.js, C++, docker, GitHub, AIX system, shell scripts, Redis, StreamServe – so a bit of everything. Also, I’ve learned the techniques of shamans - dancing with tambourines. 

One of the most interesting tasks with witch I’ve worked is microservice for reading and transmitting the serial number of an IOT device. It is very useful when you need to add many IOT devices to the database or bind devices to each other. This microservice is a small web application for connecting a mobile device with a desktop application without installing special programs. It was very interesting for me, because such a small application uses many different technologies (vue.js, php, redis, docker, qr-code extensions and many other) and this application can be used in the different projects.

I said that 2019 was difficult for me. I were mistaken. Each next year became harder and harder. So we had to move to Georgia this March. I never choose easy ways, so we've been going 5 days by car, from Minsk to Tbilisi, 4 people and a cat. I turned 27 and I realized that I need to move on. So, I decided to return to the RS school again. My wife, of course, supported me (I’m just kidding. She said she want a new iPhone!). So, this time I am much more detErmined and serious, I approach tasks responsibly and creatively (you can appreciate my css meme slider and laugh at a minion and at other memes).

I quickly assimilate information (I came to the courses almost forgetting some information about JS, because I’ve been working with StreamServe for last 2 years), but nevertheless, for most of the tasks I got high scores. I can solve problems and I'm not afraid of difficulties.

I like to make something with my own hands (for example, I designed and assembled the kitchen in the house, did electricity and water supply, set up the smart home function, and many other things), I also like movement and speed: I was fond of sailing (I have a license to drive small motor and sail boats), riding a motorbike and bicycle. 

In conclusion, I would like to say that it took a lot of effort to make this video, but thanks my wife for always reminding me why I'm doing this. Please watch the video till the end to see how I'm looking forward for your feedback.
